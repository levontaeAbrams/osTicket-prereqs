# osTicket-prereqs and Installation 

This project is a hands-on tutorial and walkthrough that demonstrates the prerequisites, installation, and basic configuration of osTicket, an open-source help desk ticketing system commonly used in IT support environments.

The goal of this project is to simulate a real-world IT help desk setup using a cloud-hosted Windows machine and to demonstrate practical system administration skills relevant to entry-level IT and Help Desk roles.
